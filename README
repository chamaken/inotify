This repo is a fork of https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.exp/inotify
for solving issue 2483.

----------------

This subrepository holds experimental and deprecated (in the "old"
directory) packages.

The idea for this subrepository originated as the "pkg/exp" directory
of the main repository, but its presence there made it unavailable
to users of the binary downloads of the Go installation. The
subrepository has therefore been created to make it possible to "go
get" these packages.

Warning: Packages here are experimental and unreliable. Some may
one day be promoted to the main repository or other subrepository,
or they may be modified arbitrarily or even disappear altogether.

In short, code in this subrepository is not subject to the Go 1
compatibility promise. (No subrepo is, but the promise is even more
likely to be violated by go.exp than the others.)

Caveat emptor.

- If I am watching a directory, and delete it, and recreate it, 
  and watch it again, any events after that are hosed:
  - the event.Name is incomplete, with the path stripped out e.g. 
    instead of /home/myname/a/b/c/d.txt, I get /d.txt
    instead of /home/myname/a/b/c/, I get ""
  - RemoveWatch fails with message: invalid argument
  - Close() doesn't really close. Most times, the reader goroutine hangs.
